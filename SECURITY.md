# Security Policy

## Supported Versions
Currently due to rapid development cycles there is no security support for older variants of the site and if you are 
maintaining a fork of Scout Machine it is recommended that you keep up to date with the latest version.

## Reporting a Vulnerability
To report a security vulnerability either 
[create a security report](https://github.com/gryphonmachine/machine/issues/new/choose) or join the 
[Scout Machine discord](https://discord.com/invite/yYtc8gpsXK) and privately message a developer.

Please do not openly post a security vulnerability as this may put other users at risk.

You can expect a response within 24 hours of reporting a security vulnerability, and it will be made a top
priority to fix the vulnerability as soon as possible.
