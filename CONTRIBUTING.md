# How To Contribute
## 1: Fork the repository
Create a fork of the repository to your own GitHub account. This will allow you to make changes to the repository 
without requiring privileges in the source repository. [Create a Fork](https://github.com/gryphonmachine/machine/fork).
## 2: Clone the repository
Clone your fork to begin development on your local machine.
## 3: Tool Setup
### 3.1: Install Node.js
Node.js is required to run the development tools. You can download the latest version of Node.js from 
[nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en/).
### 3.2: Install Yarn
Yarn is a package manager for Node.js. It is used to install the development tools and dependencies. You can download 
the latest version of Yarn from [yarnpkg.com](https://yarnpkg.com/).
### 3.3: Install Your IDE of Choice
You can use any IDE you want to develop the project. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) & 
[WebStorm](https://www.jetbrains.com/webstorm/) both provide good support for TSX files.
### 3.4: Request a Blue Alliance API Key & an FRC Events API Key
Your local testing instance will require read access for both the FRC events & TBA APIs. You can request a TBA API key 
from [thebluealliance.com](https://www.thebluealliance.com/request/apiwrite). You can request an FRC Events API key 
from [frc-events.firstinspires.org](https://frc-events.firstinspires.org/services/API).
### 3.5: Create a .env File
Create a .env file based on the .env.example file and add your API keys to the file.

instance. The development instance will be available at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000/).

## 5: Make Changes & PR
Once you have made your changes, commit them to your fork and create a pull request to the main repository. Your changes
will be reviewed and merged into the main repository if they are approved. If you have any questions the 
[Scout Machine discord](https://discord.com/invite/yYtc8gpsXK) is available and members of the development team will be
available.
